PunnetSquareMaker
=================

A Python 2.6 program which creates Punnett squares and calculates potential offspring genotype frequencies.

To use, enter genotypes of the parents when prompted. There should be two alleles per gene (each represented by a single character), and genes should be separated by spaces.
For example, "Xx Yy ZZ" and "XX YY zz" are valid input strings, while "XxYyZZ" is not. 

The program will then print a formatted Punnett square, and list the genotype frequencies for each distinct resulting genotype.
